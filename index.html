	<h1 class="Title">End - "Atropos"</h1>
	<p>Eternally swirls the thread<br>
		Growing and weaving<br>
		Cutting and killing<br>
		Anaplasia of all energy<br> 
		Genesis till cremation<br>
		That spawns through chaos<br>
		And the copulation of Nyx
	</p>
	<p>When time takes shape<br>
		And reaches human grounds<br>
		The thread takes form and coils<br> 
		In the worm womb of creation<br>
		Flirting with danger<br>
		Flirting with collapse<br>
		And the razors of transition
	</p>
	<p>The hub pushes with all power<br>
		The continuum of life unfolds<br> 
		And passes the thread<br>
		To where it must go<br>
		Process, formation, demiurge<br>
	</p>
